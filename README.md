## üí°Inspiration
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), last year 14% of India's population suffered from mental health ailments, including 45.7 million suffering from depressive disorders and 49 million from anxiety disorders. Especially in this Covid pandemic, when most of the countries went into lockdown, it is very easy for people to feel alienated, unmotivated, and stressed which when coupled with anxiety, overthinking and irritation have led few to self-harm with some even losing their lives to mental health.

Mental health is an aspect of everyone's life, although, for some, it's more of a struggle than for others, especially at college where students are facing new and stressful stimuli every day. With a large population now working from home and staying away from loved ones, the mental health situation has deteriorated. As such, it becomes important to track and remedy any problems before they get too serious. We try to achieve this using the Companion App.

## üîç What it does
In this competitive, fast-paced, age of computers, it's very easy for people to fall prey to stress, anxiety, anger, depression, low self-esteem to name a few. The Companion app would be effective in providing guidance in lifestyle and motivation to get relief from mental health issues and also make therapy more accessible, efficient, and portable. It would give people the chance to accurately assess and track their own mental health. It would eventually helps users achieve a state of balance in life and help them uplift their mood by monitoring and managing their holistic wellness over time.
